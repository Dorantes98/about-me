    <h2>Assignment 1, Sept 20</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Coming into this assignment with no prior knowledge of HTML I had a few
                challenges I had to work through. The main thing being syntax. I used a 
                website help with syntax, for example 
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                was the main one I used for how to use images or links in a html file.
            </p>
        
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from this assignment. For one, I really like HTML and the
                idea of web development. I learned how to write a bit of HTML by using
                headers, paragraphs, images, links and i'm still working on how to make
                my file neat and easy to read when it comes to line length, tabs and 
                whitespace. Coming into this assignment I knew absolutely nothing about 
                HTML or web development. From what I've learned so far I'm excited for 
                the rest of the term.

        <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>
                Besides the lecture notes,
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                is the main website I used to help me through this assignment. I also 
                watched a couple YouTube videos on HTML to get through some challenges
                like getting images to display properly or resize an image.
