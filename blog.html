    <h2>Assignment 1, Sept 20</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Coming into this assignment with no prior knowledge of HTML I had a few
                challenges I had to work through. The main thing being syntax. I used a 
                website help with syntax, for example 
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                was the main one I used for how to use images or links in a html file.
            </p>
        
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from this assignment. For one, I really like HTML and the
                idea of web development. I learned how to write a bit of HTML by using
                headers, paragraphs, images, links and i'm still working on how to make
                my file neat and easy to read when it comes to line length, tabs and 
                whitespace. Coming into this assignment I knew absolutely nothing about 
                HTML or web development. From what I've learned so far I'm excited for 
                the rest of the term.

                Besides the lecture notes,
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                is the main website I used to help me through this assignment. I also 
                watched a couple YouTube videos on HTML to get through some challenges
                like getting images to display properly or resize an image.

    <h2>Assignment 2, Oct 28</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                I think the most difficult parts of this assignment was getting the size
                and spacing right for all the individual parts of the page. I took it
                step by step by first starting with the header of the page, then 
                the filter bar, and finally the posts. One of the challenges in this was 
                using padding vs margin and knowing when to use which one. A lot of the 
                time I was trying both to see which one worked better. Another challenge 
                I had was resizing the page. At first the posts on the page wouldn't 
                stay a fixed size and would resize according to the page size. I fixed 
                this by making sure the individual posts were a fixed size and making 
                sure the layout was a proper grid.
            </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                A lot of the styling of font, font-weight, colors, background colors, etc.
                were things I feel I had a solid grasp on while working on the project.
                I learned a lot through trial and error about padding, gaps, and margins.
                Another thing I learned about was grid-template-columns and how to use
                it to fix my resizing issues.

                I had to rewatch Oct 16 lecture about shadows in order to get the shadows 
                of the "add item" button down right. Another resource I used was 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">
                    CSS-Grid
                </a>
                 tutorial. This helped me with my resizing of the webpage.

                 I didn't have to google anything for this assignment. I was able to find
                 everything I needed through the lecture notes and rewatching videos.
                 I did look through some of the CSS reading materials on the course 
                 website to work through some challenges like the grid and resizing.
