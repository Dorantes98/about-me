    <h2>Assignment 1, Sept 20</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Coming into this assignment with no prior knowledge of HTML I had a few
                challenges I had to work through. The main thing being syntax. I used a 
                website help with syntax, for example 
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                was the main one I used for how to use images or links in a html file.
            </p>
        
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from this assignment. For one, I really like HTML and the
                idea of web development. I learned how to write a bit of HTML by using
                headers, paragraphs, images, links and i'm still working on how to make
                my file neat and easy to read when it comes to line length, tabs and 
                whitespace. Coming into this assignment I knew absolutely nothing about 
                HTML or web development. From what I've learned so far I'm excited for 
                the rest of the term.

                Besides the lecture notes,
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_text_links.htm">
                    HTML-Tutorial
                </a>
                is the main website I used to help me through this assignment. I also 
                watched a couple YouTube videos on HTML to get through some challenges
                like getting images to display properly or resize an image.

    <h2>Assignment 2, Oct 28</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                I think the most difficult parts of this assignment was getting the size
                and spacing right for all the individual parts of the page. I took it
                step by step by first starting with the header of the page, then 
                the filter bar, and finally the posts. One of the challenges in this was 
                using padding vs margin and knowing when to use which one. A lot of the 
                time I was trying both to see which one worked better. Another challenge 
                I had was resizing the page. At first the posts on the page wouldn't 
                stay a fixed size and would resize according to the page size. I fixed 
                this by making sure the individual posts were a fixed size and making 
                sure the layout was a proper grid.
            </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                A lot of the styling of font, font-weight, colors, background colors, etc.
                were things I feel I had a solid grasp on while working on the project.
                I learned a lot through trial and error about padding, gaps, and margins.
                Another thing I learned about was grid-template-columns and how to use
                it to fix my resizing issues. 
            </p>

                I had to rewatch Oct 16 lecture about shadows in order to get the shadows 
                of the "add item" button down right. Another resource I used was 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">
                    CSS-Grid
                </a>
                 tutorial. This helped me with my resizing of the webpage.
                 <br> <br>
                 I didn't have to google anything for this assignment. I was able to find
                 everything I needed through the lecture notes and rewatching videos.
                 I did look through some of the CSS reading materials on the course 
                 website to work through some challenges like the grid and resizing.

    <h2>Assignment 3, Nov 14</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges in this assignment was implementing the 
                filtering system so it worked with both the original posts 
                and any new posts I created. Initially, the filtering logic 
                worked well for the original posts, but I struggled with getting it to 
                re-filter correctly once new posts were added. Every time I applied a 
                filter, it would only consider the currently displayed posts, which led 
                to issues when I wanted to change filters or clear them altogether. when
                I tried to remove all filters and update so all the posts came back, they 
                wouldn't come back. <br><br>
                The solution involved creating a single array, allPosts, to keep track 
                of all the posts including created ones. By iterating over allPosts each 
                time I applied a filter, all the posts were considered every time, 
                even if they had been removed from the DOM based on previous filtering.
            </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I learned during this assignment how important it is to maintain a data
                structure, like my array, in order to keep track of all the posts on 
                the page. By storing all posts in a single array, I could manage 
                filtering without constantly modifying the DOM directly. I also gained a 
                better understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation, 
                especially with dynamically added elements. Another insight was the 
                importance of thinking through edge cases like clearing filters or 
                re-applying filters multiple times with different criteria.

                 I rewatched some of the lecture videos to help me remember/have a better
                 understanding of some of the things I needed to impliment into this 
                 assignment. I also used this page, 
                 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax"
                 > Spread Syntax </a> in order to clean up my code a little bit.
                 <br><br>
                 I had to google why my for loop wasn't working, I read through some 
                 sites but couldn't find a fix for my issue. I then posted my code 
                 snippet into chatGPT to see if it could find an issue with my code, 
                 which also did not lead to a solution but gave me a resouce on
                 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" 
                 >forEach</a>
                 functions which helped me with my allPosts function.
